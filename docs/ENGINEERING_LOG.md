# Engineering Log — Texas ISD Finances

Append-only session memory. **Newest entries at the top.** Written for an
engineer (human or AI) with zero prior context. Maintained by the `/ariba`
skill — see `.claude/skills/ariba/SKILL.md`. Never put secrets here.

Entry template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line headline>
**What changed:** facts — files, deployments, data.
**Why:** the reasoning git can't record.
**Gotchas:** anything that cost real time to figure out.
**Open items:** carried forward + new.
**Notes:** (quick /ariba note additions land here)
```

## 2026-07-22 — Memory system created (/ariba skill, CLAUDE.md, this log)

**What changed:** Added `.claude/skills/ariba/SKILL.md` (catch-up / save /
note modes), `CLAUDE.md` boot file, and this log, seeded with the project's
full history below. All committed to `claude/audit-public-launch-ocd7ra`.

**Why:** Agent sessions are ephemeral containers with zero memory. The repo
is the only durable store, so project memory must be committed files that
every future session auto-loads (CLAUDE.md) or is instructed to read
(/ariba). Design principle: log decisions WITH rationale, verify live state
before trusting notes, never store secrets.

**Open items:** see Current Status block in CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-07-22 — WENT LIVE: Supabase provisioned, TEA data loaded, Vercel production deploy, PR #1 opened

**What changed:**
- Created Supabase project `texas-isd-finances` (ref `zwhvabkvrexphlskubog`,
  us-east-1, org "GOAT-UIX") via Management API using the user's PAT.
- Downloaded TEA's current "Summarized PEIMS Actual Financial Data" release
  directly from tea.texas.gov (`/media/423296`, ~19 MB, sheet `DATAMART`) —
  fresher than the project ever had: fiscal 2009–2025.
- Ran `scripts/prepare_data.py` → 20,587 rows × 140 cols; loaded via
  PostgREST in 1,000-row batches (direct Postgres is blocked in the dev
  container — HTTPS only); applied `sql/create_tables.sql` via Management
  API query endpoint.
- Deployed to Vercel (project `texas-isd-finances`, account `tag-ai`) with
  env vars `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (transaction pooler, port 6543) and
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Live: https://texas-isd-finances.vercel.app
- Opened PR #1 (audit branch → master).
- Shredded all locally staged credentials after deploy.

**Why key decisions went the way they did:**
- Transaction pooler (6543) for serverless; asyncpg needs
  `statement_cache_size=0` with it (added in `src/api.py`).
- Vercel deploy uses `requirements-vercel.txt` (full API incl. NLP, minus
  pandas/matplotlib/etc.) to stay under the 500 MB bundle cap. NLP works in
  production — verified with a real Dallas ISD question.
- Restructured `sql/create_tables.sql` to run AFTER import: the old static
  CREATE TABLE defined only 21 of 140 real columns, so the documented
  schema-first order could never import.

**Gotchas (each cost real time — don't rediscover):**
- Live testing caught bugs static review missed: (1) pandas re-reading the
  clean CSV stripped leading zeros from district IDs — fixed in DB with
  `LPAD(...,6,'0')` and in `import_to_supabase.py` with
  `dtype={"district_number": str}`; (2) `/anomalies?year=X` returned
  unflagged rows — flag condition now always applied; (3) the real TEA
  column is `all_funds_instruction_transfer_expend_fct11_95`, not the
  invented `all_funds_instruction_expend`.
- The dev container cannot open raw TCP to Postgres; use Supabase
  Management API (`POST /v1/projects/{ref}/database/query`) for SQL and
  PostgREST (service_role key, `Prefer: return=minimal`) for bulk inserts.

**Open items:** credential rotation (user-side), `/query` rate limit,
merge PR #1, Supabase free-tier idle-pause watch.

## 2026-07-22 — Audit round 2: everything validated against current provider docs

**What changed:** Rewrote `src/nlp_engine.py` on LangChain 1.x
`create_agent` (pinned `langchain>=1.0,<2.0`); fixed `env_template.txt` to
lead with the Supabase session-pooler string; fixed `vercel.json`
(`excludeFiles`, not the unsupported `includeFiles`); removed dead Pydantic
models; added `tests/test_nlp_engine.py` (constructs the real agent against
SQLite so LangChain API drift fails CI); added `PROJECT_MAP.md`.

**Why:** User mandate: assume nothing, validate every assumption against
current docs. It paid off — three latent production-killers found.

**Gotchas:**
- `create_sql_agent` no longer exists in langchain 1.x — `/query` was dead
  on any fresh install and round-1 tests had masked it by not importing the
  module. Lesson: every module needs at least an import/construction test.
- Supabase direct host (`db.<ref>.supabase.co`) is IPv6-only without a paid
  add-on; Render/Railway/Vercel egress IPv4 → always use the pooler.
- `langchain-community` sunset June 2026 (still works; watch issue #674).
- SQLite dialect lacks materialized-view reflection → NLP engine takes an
  injected `SQLDatabase` in tests; Postgres path uses `view_support=True`.
- Git-history secret scan: no full secrets, but old Supabase project ref
  `emtwbizmorqwhboebgzw` visible in deleted internal docs → rotate that
  project's creds if still live.

## 2026-06-01 → 2026-07-19 — Audit round 1 and launch prep (branch created)

**What changed:** On branch `claude/audit-public-launch-ocd7ra`: fixed
broken relative import (app could never boot via documented command); made
NLP engine lazy so the app boots without credentials (data endpoints 503
cleanly, /health reports "degraded"); fixed CORS (wildcard+credentials
invalid), Plotly `update_xaxes`/`update_yaxes`, scatter trendline, SQL
column interpolation; enabled the RLS the README promised; migrated to
lifespan handler. Added `static/index.html` public portal, pytest suite,
enforcing CI, `Dockerfile`, `render.yaml`, `api/index.py`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`,
`AUDIT.md`. Earlier commits (pre-audit) sanitized credentials and added
LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY.

**Why:** Repo was a prototype: nothing had ever actually run end-to-end.
Goal was public-launch readiness with graceful degradation so deploy could
precede credential wiring.

**Gotchas:** CI previously used `ruff --exit-zero` (never fails) and a
"type check" that only printed a version — green CI proved nothing.
